This is a to do list of things I am thinking of and need to find a solution for

1. First, I need to figure out what the results I have are. Did I manage to find a way to see progress of students or did I find out that the progress of students could very well be just mixed with them learning the answers on their own

2. Second, How to read from the bootstrap, this is something I can get help from Þórarinn for. Since if I have that, then I can use that to talk about the rest of the results

3. Third, what would be the next steps after this project. As in how would you test the next points?
